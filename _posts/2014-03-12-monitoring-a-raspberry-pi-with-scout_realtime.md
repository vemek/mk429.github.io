I used to be a bit of a monitoring geek, and ran a variety of software from cacti to nagios to munin on all the boxes I owned in order to see how they were ticking along. At some point I came to my senses and realised this was overkill, and so my boxes ticked on unmonitored, without a second thought given. That is, until I recently came across <a href="http://scoutapp.github.io/scout_realtime/">scout_realtime</a> - a lightweight, pretty and easy to install system monitor from the guys at Scout.

Here's the plugin I use to generate my category and tag index pages. I can still host my site on Github Pages, as this will create standard jekyll index pages, which will pull in all posts for the tag in question. I only need to run this when I introduce an entirely new tag or category, not every time I write a post.

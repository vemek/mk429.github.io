I used to be a bit of a monitoring geek, and ran a variety of software from cacti to nagios to munin on all the boxes I owned in order to see how they were ticking along. At some point I came to my senses and realised this was overkill, and so my boxes ticked on unmonitored, without a second thought given. That is, until I recently came across <a href="http://scoutapp.github.io/scout_realtime/">scout_realtime</a> - a lightweight, pretty and easy to install system monitor from the guys at Scout.
